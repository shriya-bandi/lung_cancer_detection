#Lung Cancer Detection

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a lung cancer detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a given set of features extracted from lung cancer patients' data indicates the presence of lung cancer or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about lung cancer patients. Each data point consists of various features such as age, gender, smoking history, medical history, and specific biomarkers that may be indicative of lung cancer. The dataset has been pre-processed to handle missing values and outliers.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a critical step to ensure the quality of the data used for training the machine learning models. The following steps were performed during data preprocessing:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Any missing values in the dataset were dealt with using appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal of incomplete samples.

2. **Handling Outliers**: Outliers were identified and treated with techniques like truncation or replacing them with more appropriate values based on domain knowledge.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features may have been derived or transformed to enhance the model's ability to capture patterns in the data effectively.

## Feature Scaling

Feature scaling is essential when using distance-based machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or K-means. In this project, we applied feature scaling techniques like Min-Max scaling or Standardization to bring all features to a similar scale.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the data distribution and identifying patterns and correlations between features. We used the Seaborn library to create various visualizations, such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps, to gain insights into the data.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

For the lung cancer detection task, we experimented with the following machine learning algorithms:

1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm for classification tasks. We utilized the SVM algorithm with appropriate kernel functions to build a predictive model for lung cancer detection.

2. **K-means Clustering**: Although an unsupervised algorithm, K-means was applied to explore potential natural clusters within the data. However, the main focus of the project is lung cancer detection, so K-means was not used for the final predictions.

3. **Naive Bayes**: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm that assumes independence between features. We tested its performance on the dataset to compare it with SVM.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of our lung cancer detection models, we employed the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions on the test set.
- **Precision**: The ability of the model to correctly classify positive cases.
- **Recall**: The ability of the model to correctly identify actual positive cases.
- **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: To understand the distribution of predicted classes and actual classes.

## Conclusion

The lung cancer detection project presented in this repository demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to identify the presence of lung cancer based on input features. 
The project showcases the successful implementation of SVM, K-means, and Naive Bayes algorithms, with SVM achieving the highest accuracy. 
The repository serves as a starting point for further research and improvements in lung cancer detection using machine learning.
